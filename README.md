## ANTÜ website
This is a landing page to show the products and the different resources of a brand. It is a combination of the aesthetics of the brand and my design. It is responsive, interactive and has the key links to be redirected. I worked with this brand before when designing the catalog and the digital illustrations for the Instagram account.
